# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

## Project description
For the project description and requirements please see the original repo below:\
https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata



## Approach
After analysing the existing code and requirements I realised there were five types of items:
1. Normal items
2. Aged brie
3. Sulfuras
4. Backstage passes
5. Conjured items

I then completed the challenge in the following four steps:

1. Create an input/output table using the requirements (see section below)
2. Add automated tests for the existing code using the input output table
3. Refactor the existing code
4. Add the new feature


## Technology used
- Language: Ruby
